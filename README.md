### This is Pick-It-Up, an application to easily store your finds.

_As a user:_

- You can securely create an account to save and access items.
- You can create and delete items with a photo, notes, and a location.
- You can look at a detailed view of an item to see more information about it.
- You can click on a map to save the coordinates of that location.
- You can save items that cannot be accessed by other users.

A lot of my hobbies include going to different places to find a variety of items. I like to metal detect, arrowhead hunt, mushroom hunt, and fossil hunt. Over the years I have collected
lots of items. Over time I forget exactly where I found things or what stratigraphic age they are. With this app a user can save details about items, the location they were found, and the category of item they are. A user can choose to add to previous locations or add a new one using a React Leaflet Map. A user can save a photo, notes, and a location for each item. There is a list of all a user's items. Those items can be clicked on to see a detailed view with item and location info. A user can view stratigraphic data for the coordinates of their locations. I used Macrostrat API ( https://macrostrat.org/ ) to accomplish this.
